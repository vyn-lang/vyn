# Vyn

**Vyn** is a programming language that compiles to portable bytecode, allowing you to compile once and execute anywhere.

## Why Vyn?

- **Static Typing:** Type safety at compile time helps catch errors before runtime.

- **Portable Bytecode:** Compile to `.vync` bytecode files that run on any platform with the Vyn runtime.

- **Simple & Clean:** Designed with clarity and ease of use in mind from the ground up.

- **Fast Runtime:** Register-based virtual machine for efficient execution.

## Current Status

⚠️ **Early Development** - Vyn is currently in active development. The language is taking shape and much more is on the way!
