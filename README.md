# Vyn

**Vyn** is a programming language that compiles to portable bytecode, allowing you to compile once and execute anywhere.

## Why Vyn?

- **Static Typing:** Type safety at compile time helps catch errors before runtime.

- **Portable Bytecode:** Compile to `.vync` bytecode files that run on any platform with the Vyn runtime.

- **Simple & Clean:** Designed with clarity and ease of use in mind from the ground up.

## Current Status

⚠️ **Early Development** - Vyn is currently in active development. The language is taking shape and much more is on the way!

## Getting Started

_Installation and usage instructions will be added as the language develops._

### Example

```vyn
// Coming soon - example Vyn code
```

## Roadmap

Plans for Vyn's development include:

- Control flow structures (if/else, loops)
- Functions and procedures
- Standard library
- More complete type system
- Performance optimizations
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Building from Source

_Coming soon_
