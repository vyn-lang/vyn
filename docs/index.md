# Vyn

**Vyn** is a statically typed programming language that compiles to portable bytecode.

## What is Vyn?

Vyn is designed for clarity, type safety, and portability. Write your code once, compile it to `.vync` bytecode, and run it anywhere with the Vyn runtime.

### Key Features

- **Static Typing:** Catch errors at compile time with a robust type system
- **Portable Bytecode:** Compile once, run anywhere - `.vync` files work on any platform with the Vyn runtime
- **Clean Syntax:** Intuitive and readable syntax inspired by modern languages
- **Fast Runtime:** Register-based virtual machine for efficient execution

## Documentation

- **[Getting Started](getting-started/index.md)** - Installation, setup, and your first program
- **[Basics](basics/index.md)** - Variables, types, operators, and core concepts
- **[Control Flow](control-flow/index.md)** - Conditionals, loops, and program flow

_More documentation sections coming soon as features are implemented._
